This project took me a long time, and I think the biggest struggle was with the various pointers I needed to use. Roscoe was very helpful in 
providing support and pointing me (no pun intended) in the right direction. After completing the tests and writing my main, working on memory
errors also took me a while to complete. I have cited my sources and everything should work properly.
